## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

-   Introduce yourself and show a picture of yourself
-   Provide basic biographical information: birthday, where you grew up
-   Show a picture of your favorite animal
-   Provide your favorite plot, generated in either R or python. (This can be one you've generated in this class). Ensure that the code does not show, but the plot does.
-   Provide a link to your CV, which you will generate in the next part.
